    <h2> About me </h2>
    <p>As a Computer Science major entering my final year at Brooklyn College, I am dedicated to learning as much as possible before graduation. I truly enjoy the challenge of figuring out the most difficult parts of the development process and look forward to maximizing my remaining time in the program.</p>
